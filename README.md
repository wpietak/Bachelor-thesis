## **Abstract**

The problem of economic calculation has been first formulated over 100 years ago and provoked the so-called calculation debate, which played a significant role in the history of economic thought. The problem of economic calculation concerns possibility of rational allocation of economic resources in a socialist economy with no private ownership of production means. In such an economy there is no exchange of production factors, and therefore, the true market prices cannot emerge. It is thus impossible to compare inputs and outputs stemming from particular economic activities, due to which it is unknown which ones are worth undertaking. The work illustrates the mentioned problem with a use of an agent-based model involving entrepreneurs, production factors and consumption goods. Entrepreneurs produce consumption goods using the available production factors. They can either be subject to market pricing or not - depending on whether they are private or collectivized. The results of the simulation have shown a negative impact of the collectivization of production factors on the satisfaction of consumers' needs. The impact gets more severe as the economy grows.
